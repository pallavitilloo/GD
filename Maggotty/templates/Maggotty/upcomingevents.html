            <p class="text-justify">Students came together on a day without classes to celebrate University Day. Under a beautiful autumn sky on the Student Center Quad, students enjoyed ice cream, created with sidewalk chalk, danced, played games and showed off their Red Hawk Pride, a one-day break that brought the campus together – outdoors and socially distanced –  during a fall semester like no other.
