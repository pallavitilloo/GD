            <h2 class="mt-0">Celebrating University Day</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">Students came together on a day without classes to celebrate University Day.

                <p class="text-justify">Wearing masks was not what the Povolo quintuplets had in mind when they pictured their college experience. But as they navigate a semester like no other, Victoria, Masha, Ashley, Michael and Marcus are making the most of a semester where face coverings are part of everyday life.
